## Navigating through the src folder

- Entry Point to the FE - is the index.js 
- Main File - App.js 
    - Add your components into the App.js, there's already Login Component available. 

### Assets 
    Any images/icons required to be used in the project must be added into the assets folder. 
### Pages
    The main pages of the project are created in this folder. FYI, Login.js is created for you. 
    There are 3 pages in this project - Login, Dashboard(Apprenticeships), Create Apprenticeship page.
### Components
    The reusable components are created in this folder. There would be individual folders for Pages, for example, all login components like Input Fields, Buttons would go under the "Login" folder inside "Components". 
### Context 
    Any API/fetch hooks helpers would be created in this folder. 
### Styles
    There are two stylesheets - global.css: which contains all the global styles like Font, Colours etc. Individual stylesheets for pages can be created here as well like Login.css is already created for you. 


## Remember D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) - try to reuse code, components wherever applicable and Keep it Simple! :)
